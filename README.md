## 🍺 Beer Market Segmentation (K=2 vs. K=3)

**Objective**: Help Kirin and other beer brands penetrate the U.S. market by identifying consumer segments and tailoring product and marketing strategies accordingly.

### Techniques:
- K-Means Clustering (K=2, K=3)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Discriminant Analysis for descriptor-based prediction

### Key Insights:
- **K=2 Solution (Preferred)**: 61% accuracy
  - Segment 1: Light, affordable beer drinkers
  - Segment 2: Quality-conscious, premium seekers
- **K=3 Solution**: Adds a third, price-sensitive group but with lower model accuracy (43%)

## 🚗 Infiniti G20 Positioning

**Objective**: Evaluate if Infiniti G20 can be marketed as a "cheaper BMW 318i."

### Highlights:
- Competitive perceptual mapping (prestige, sportiness, service, economy)
- Position G20 as a value-focused, practical alternative to BMW
- Target Segment 1 with rebranding focused on tech, urban lifestyle, and affordability

## 📋 FLIP Certification Survey Analysis

**Objective**: Improve a student survey measuring interest in financial certifications.

### Issues Addressed:
- Screening bias (excluding non-finance majors)
- Missing "N/A" options and vague frequency scales
- Lack of open-ended feedback

### Segment Findings (Cluster Analysis):
- **Cluster 0**: Experienced learners, low price sensitivity
- **Cluster 1**: Ambitious professionals, high e-learning comfort
- **Cluster 2**: New grads, dependent on campus support

## 📚 Addison-Wesley Book Marketing Strategy

**Objective**: Recommend which business book (Tellis, Lilien/Rangaswamy, Rao/Steckel) to prioritize.

### Strategic Options:
- **Traditional**: Focus on Tellis for steady, low-risk returns
- **Leading-Edge**: Invest in Lilien/Rangaswamy to capture growth
- **Balanced**: Moderate investment in all titles

## 🤖 Telepresence Technology Adoption Strategy

**Objective**: Forecast Remote Telepresence Unit (RTU) adoption and guide Microsoft’s market entry strategy.

### Scenarios Modeled:
- **Pessimistic (Fax-like):** ~$1–2B niche market
- **Realistic (LinkedIn-like):** ~$3–4B, moderate adoption
- **Optimistic (3D Printer-like):** ~$7B, rapid growth

### Recommendations:
- Integrate with Microsoft Teams
- Target healthcare and education
- Acquire key players and lead standardization
